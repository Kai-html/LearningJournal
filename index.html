<!-- Keep a learning journal: At the end of each day, reflect upon your learning: when were you learning passively, without thinking
much about what you were watching or reading, and why do you think that is? What could you have done differently next time? -->

<h2 class=h>Friday:</h2>
<p class=p>Did not do much, I reviewed my tracker and opened up the things that I needed to do.</p>
<h2 class=h>Saturday:</h2>
<p class=p>I timed myself going through the "Web Design in 4 Minutes" site. I spent time on 
each feature, messing around with the code to more understand what each line 
of html was actually doing to the page. Spent around 3 hours on that.</p>
<h2 class=h>Sunday:</h2>
<p class=p>Reviewed what I did yesterday, and started to create the waldo game. It was
really frusturating trying to get things to work... Watched the "Breaking
Down a Visual Problem in 3 Ways" Video. I left pretty confused. I tried
to apply the concepts in the video to what I knew how to do, but it did
not really pan out.</p>
<h2 class=h>Monday:</h2>
<p class=p>Worked more on waldo game. Spent a lot of time on the "Video" page, trying 
to make things look better. Created a cast of file progress on this file.</p>
<h2 class=h>Tuesday:</h2>
<p class=p>Finished Waldo Game!! Hosted it as well! Even though it's barely a website, I'm pretty
proud of it.</p>
<h2 class=h>Wednesday:</h2>
<p class=p>The "Video" page is now able to communicate with itself!!! (It's not hosted yet, will 
work on that on Thursday). I can click to different pages on the site! <a href="https://kai-hthml.github.io/VideositeHOME">HERE! It has been since hosted</a>
